Hello world! My name is Isaque i'm 22 years old and i'm from Brazil. 
I'm Christian of Assembly of God and game programmer. I was approved to Central Methodist University in Fayette-Missouri to Computer Science with a good eSports scholarship but we can't afford with it cause it's expensive since dollar is actually really high for us, so i'm seeking for help!
I'm still learning programming and have some projects that i already have started and some of them still only written.
